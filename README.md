## Task - Library Management System

Student and faculty can borrow books with different limits & durations. Each book will have different ID. Also, each book
of the same name and same author (but different number of copies) will have different ID. Entry of all the book will be
done, who borrows that book and when and also duration. Detail of fine (when the book is not returned on time) is also
stored. Books are acquired thru either purchase, donation or on-loan (with a set time period). Certain books may have
restrictions on if they can be removed from the library in which case its borrowing duration may be less than a day but
multiple reservations may be made at one time. Think of any university library.
